    "The regression model proposed is motivated by relationship between housing and income. Housing index should be positively affected by peopleâ€™s income and well being; however, should be negatively affected by unemployment.Also independent variables like number of employee that receive adequate social assistance or education and health service should have a linear relationship with housing index, instead of log relationship. Log relationship measures percentage change in variables, which should not be suitable for a dependent variable of housing index. Thus the model is : \n",
